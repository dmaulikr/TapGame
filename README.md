# TapGame

The only two files you need in this repo is: 
- TapGameSession.h
- TapGameSession.m

The accompanying files (including the Storyboard and View Controller) are simply examples of how to integrate the game using the delegate methods. The game is extremely flexible and you can just close and run it to see how it works. 

To view the example, download or close the project and run in an iPhone 6 simulator. The buttons will highlight to show the sequence and tapping them in the correct order will progress the game. There is also a detailed console output for testing incase you need to refer to it. 

Let me know when BAB is done and if you'd like me to try and integrate this into your UI. I'll need the assets to make this happen or can simply wire it up when you're done.
